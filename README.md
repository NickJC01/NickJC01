# Hi, I'm Nick 👋

CS @ Sonoma State:
My projects may be small, but they are mighty.

This github profile is a work in progress while I begin the process of removing patchwork student repositories and uploading the projects that I think should be public

**Interests:** database management, web application development, network engineering
